plot_RTMA_inc.py
This is similar to the simple_plot and plot_RAP_wrfout, but it is for RTMA increments. Note it used wrfpython so you must point to a python version with that package.  On Jet it works with the following.

simple_plot.py
The simple_plot.py plots a single variable at a single model level from a wrfout or wrfinput file and displays on x11.
It is set to plot water vapor, you can choose another varaible from the wrfout. You would need to update the plot title.
No countour intervals or color maps are set in this example.
There are several domain options that can be commented in/out. For a plot over Colorado counties can be plotted. 

eta2height.py
This reads wrfout and converts eta levels to heights or pressure to see model level info. Then it can plots the heights/pressure and their spacing between levels.


plot_RAP_wrfout.py
Plots composite cloud (2D vertical sum of water and ice) from a RAP wrfout file and displays on x11.
The plot domain is based on the grid domain. There is an example of setting contour intervals.
